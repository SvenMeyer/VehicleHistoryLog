# VehicleHistoryLog

## Motivation
A vehicle's value is to a great extend determined by the miles driven and the service history. Historically paper-based log books have been used to keep a record, but fraudulent car dealer like to manipulate them to pretend a lower milage and better service history in order to gain a higher price. In addition, blank car service history log books are easily available to everybody on ebay which makes this fraud even easiert to carry out.

To fix this process a blockchain based system shall be developed.
Blockchain based system have quite some outstanding features, with most of them being highly desireable for this application:

* multiple parties need to share a joint view on a dataset
* tamper proof data : no entry can be changed once it has been added
* tamper proof system behavior : once deployed, the code which is defining the behavior of the system, can not be changed
* each data entry and code deployment is time stamped
* decentralized : there is no single system which cab fail
* open : all code and data is openly accessible and thus verifiable
* consorship resistant : nobody can stop the system
