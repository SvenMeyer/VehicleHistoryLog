## Design Patterns

For the outlined requirements, an implementation based on Non-Fungible-Token (NFT) as defined in [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) seems to be a perfect fit.

Every ERC-721 compliant contract must implement the ERC721 and ERC165 interfaces:
[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md)  
[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-165.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-165.md)

Given the limited time to implement this projects as well as the fact that the standard is pretty new, and to reuse as much implementation knowledge and effort which has been made available on this new topic so far, the [ERC721Token](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Token.sol) implementation from OpenZeppelin will be used as a basis for this project.

The ERC721Vehicle contract will inherit from the ERC721Token, which will give it the basic NFT functionaliy. ERC721Token inherits from ERC721BasicToken and implements the interfaces ERC721, ERC721Enumerable and ERC721Metadata. To get a better overview, a [UML class/contract diagram](./UML/UML%20ERC721%20Vehicle.svg) has been created which can be found in the UML folder.


## Development tools setup

For ease of development and testing within [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) all contracts, including the contracts from the ERC721 library implementation of OpenZeppelin reside in the contracts folder. Running [remixd](https://github.com/ethereum/remixd) pointing to the local contracts folders (easily being done on Linux using the provided remixd.sh file), enables the possibility to link Remix to this local folder. This allows testing all functions of the contracts with the autogenerated UI, having the files securely  storedlocally, and accessible by other local editors and tools. Changes either in Remix or any tool working on the local files will be synced in both directions.


## Development and Implementation Approach

Initially only the contracts were developed using Remix with the described setup.

Following that, the contracts were integrated into a truffle project structure (generated by truffle init).

During following interations, a few integrations with various React project folder structures and boiler plates were conducted and evaluated, with finally using a truffle + React + next.js setup based on a [truffle-next box](https://truffleframework.com/boxes/truffle-next).
